## Guide
This simple command line program written in Python calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to N (the number passed).

For example calculator_add(5) results in 15. See the code in app/logic.py.

You can run the program in your terminal by doing 'python app/logic.py'

## Tests
To demonstrate and practice TDD using Python's unittest, some test cases have been defined in test/test_logic.py.

You can run the tests using pytest or nosetests.
